# Smart Kiosk Assistant

A voice-driven, retrieval-augmented kiosk assistant for retail, QSR, and similar customer-facing deployments. Speak a question in the browser; the assistant transcribes it, answers from a domain knowledge base, and speaks the reply back. Runs locally on Intel CPU/GPU via OpenVINO.

## What It Offers

- Browser mic capture and sequential TTS playback (no host mic passthrough needed).
- Streaming retrieval-augmented answers, domain-aware (QSR / retail / generic).
- Document ingestion from the UI (`.txt` / `.md` or raw text) with a configurable token cap.
- Five services wired together by one `docker-compose.yml`; pinned configs for reproducible behaviour.
- Sample knowledge bases in [knowledge-base-samples/](knowledge-base-samples/).

## Run

Clone with the `edge-ai-libraries/` submodule, then start the stack:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/unarayan/voice-enabled-interactions.git
cd voice-enabled-interactions/smart-kiosk-assistant
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open the UI at [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860).

For terminal-only mic mode, see [docs/run-standalone.md](docs/run-standalone.md). Full container instructions: [docs/run-container.md](docs/run-container.md).
